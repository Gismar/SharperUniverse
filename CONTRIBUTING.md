# Contributing

SharperUniverse is open to contributions from anyone. If you want a good place to get started, take a look at the issues tagged as [help wanted](https://github.com/rubynova/sharperuniverse/labels/help%20wanted).

## Pull Request Process

When submitting a PR, please follow these guidelines:

1.  Try to stay consistent with the coding style used in the project already.
2.  Your code must be unit tested with NUnit (and all tests must pass).
3.  All changes should be listed in your pull request. If your changes modify the original functionality to a degree where the documentation is no longer accurate, you should update the documentation to reflect this.

Even if meeting all these requirements, your PR may be denied if it causes a breaking change. If you want to discuss any possibly breaking changes, please open an issue first.

## Code of Conduct

We require any contributors to SharperUniverse to follow the [code of conduct as outlined in the relevant document](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
